  "sceneDescription": "Here is a detailed scene description for the theme: **\"Enchanted Forest\"**.\n\n### Scene: The Veridian Labyrinth\n\n---\n\n### 1. VISUAL IDENTITY\n\n*   **Primary Color Palette:**\n    *   Deep Verdant Green (#3E602B): The color of ancient, damp moss and the waxy leaves of oversized flora.\n    *   Twilight Teal (#0D4C5C): The base color for the deep shadows and the ambient glow of the forest floor.\n    *   Luminous Magenta (#8A2E6B): The primary color for bioluminescent fungi, glowing flower petals, and magical energy.\n*   **Secondary/Accent Colors:**\n    *   Pale Cyan (#9EF8EE) for glowing spores, ethereal sprites, and the light cast by magical flora.\n    *   Ancient Gold (#C1A574) for subtle patterns on ruined stonework and shimmering pollen motes.\n*   **Overall Mood and Atmosphere:** Ethereal and ancient. The mood is serene and mystical, yet holds a deep sense of mystery and potential danger. It feels alive, breathing, and watching.\n*   **Lighting Conditions:** Perpetual twilight. A colossal, dense canopy of interlocking, silver-barked trees blocks out most direct sunlight. The primary light sources are internal and magical: clusters of glowing mushrooms, pulsating plant life, and shimmering swarms of dust-sized sprites. Soft, hazy god-rays of cyan and magenta pierce the canopy in rare clearings.\n\n### 2. ARCHITECTURE\n\n*   **Building Styles and Materials:** The only structures are the crumbling ruins of a long-forgotten civilization, now fully integrated with the forest. The architecture is built from a pale, almost white stone that seems to faintly absorb the surrounding magical light. It’s a mix of weathered marble and a harder, unidentifiable material.\n*   **Structural Characteristics:** Organic and flowing. The ruins feature sweeping arches, curved walls, and broken spires that mimic the shapes of plants and bones. There are no sharp, 90-degree angles. Everything is worn smooth by time and covered in thick layers of moss.\n*   **Scale and Proportions:** The architecture is massive and cyclopean, built for beings much larger than the player character. A single fallen pillar can serve as a bridge across a chasm. Doorways are yawning arches tall enough for a giant to walk through.\n*   **Distinctive Architectural Features:** Faded, intricate carvings of swirling vines and celestial patterns can be seen on stone surfaces where the moss has worn thin. Broken, multi-faceted crystals are embedded in window frames, refracting the ambient light into tiny rainbows. Statues of graceful, horned beings are being slowly consumed by python-like roots.\n\n### 3. GROUND SURFACES\n\n*   **Road/Path Materials:** There are no formal roads, only winding desire paths of compacted, dark earth. These paths are often crisscrossed by thick, gnarled roots that the player must step over. Many paths are carpeted in a soft, glowing blue-green moss that puffs up little clouds of cyan spores with each footstep.\n*   **Walkable Urban Surfaces:** In areas with ruins, the ground is a mosaic of cracked and tilted flagstones. Many are missing, revealing the loamy soil and roots beneath. These stone floors are slick with moisture and overgrown with patches of deep green moss.\n*   **Decorative Terrain:** The forest floor is littered with smooth, river-worn stones of various sizes, all covered in moss. Piles of rubble from collapsed arches and walls create impassable barriers. Thickets of thorny, magenta-colored vines block certain areas.\n*   **Hazardous Areas:** Small, perfectly still pools of shimmering, mercury-like water dot the landscape. They look beautiful but may be toxic or have strange magical properties. Deep, shadow-filled chasms with glowing fungi lining their walls are also present.\n\n### 4. PROPS & OBJECTS\n\n*   **Street Furniture:** Instead of lamps, there are tall, slender fungi that grow in clusters, their caps pulsing with a soft, magenta light. Smooth, moss-covered fallen logs and crescent-shaped stone benches from the ruins serve as resting spots.\n*   **Infrastructure:** No modern infrastructure exists. Giant, exposed root systems act as natural barriers and walls. Thick curtains of hanging, phosphorescent vines function as doorways into hidden alcoves.\n*   **Vegetation and Natural Elements:** The flora is otherworldly.\n    *   **Canopy Trees:** Immense, silver-barked trees whose leaves are a dark, waxy green.\n    *   **Glimmerwood Fungi:** The primary light source. They grow in tiered clusters on trees and ruins, from hand-sized buttons to massive shelves five feet across.\n    *   **Bellflowers:** Large, drooping flowers with petals of deep purple that chime softly when the player passes by.\n    *   **Crystal Ferns:** Knee-high ferns whose fronds have a delicate, crystalline structure that glitters in the light.\n*   **Interactive/Atmospheric Objects:** Bulbous, pulsating plant pods that burst and release a cloud of harmless, sparkling gold spores when the player gets too close. Swarms of tiny, cyan sprites flutter around the Glimmerwood Fungi. Ethereal, translucent snails with glowing spiral shells slowly crawl up stone walls.\n*   **Debris and Environmental Details:** Fallen leaves the size of shields lie scattered on the ground. Shattered pieces of the ruin's crystal windows litter the base of walls. Empty, iridescent cocoons, disturbingly large, cling to the underside of giant mushroom caps.\n\n### 5. WORLD FLAVOR\n\n*   **Cultural or Era Influences:** The aesthetic blends the natural, flowing lines of Art Nouveau with a primeval, untouched wilderness. The ruins suggest a highly advanced magical civilization that lived in harmony with nature before disappearing.\n*   **Technology Level and Aesthetic:** Purely magical and organic. There is no metal, fire, or conventional technology. Light, structure, and life are all sustained by the innate magic of the forest.\n*   **Environmental Storytelling:** The sheer scale of the ruins and the size of some natural elements (leaves, cocoons) hint that the former inhabitants, and perhaps the current ones, were giants or possess immense power. The forest has not destroyed the ruins but rather reclaimed and incorporated them, suggesting a cycle of life and decay that spans millennia.\n*   **Unique Distinguishing Features:** The most memorable feature is the \"River of Stars\"—a slow-moving, shallow stream not of water, but of a viscous, dark liquid filled with glittering particles that look like a flowing galaxy. It emits a soft, musical hum and is a source of pure magical energy for the surrounding forest."
