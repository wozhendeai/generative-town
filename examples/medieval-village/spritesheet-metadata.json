  "sceneDescription": "Here is a detailed scene description for the theme: **\"medieval village\"**.\n\n---\n\n### Scene: Oakhaven Village - Market Square\n\n### 1. VISUAL IDENTITY\n\n*   **Primary Color Palette:**\n    *   Warm Oak Brown (`#A06B3E`): Dominant color for wooden structures, beams, doors, and fences.\n    *   Mossy Green (`#6A823B`): For thatch, ground cover, and foliage.\n    *   Cobblestone Grey (`#8D8D8B`): For paths, stone foundations, and the central well.\n*   **Secondary/Accent Colors:**\n    *   Terracotta Red (`#B85C5C`): Used for clay roof tiles on more important buildings (like the tavern), flower pots, and faded paint on window shutters.\n    *   Wattle Cream (`#E1D4A7`): The color of the plaster between the dark wooden beams of the houses.\n*   **Overall Mood and Atmosphere:** Cozy, rustic, and lived-in. The village feels peaceful but bustling with quiet activity. It's a place of respite, a warm pocket of civilization nestled against the wilderness. The air feels clean and smells of woodsmoke and damp earth.\n*   **Lighting Conditions:** Late afternoon, the \"golden hour.\" The sun is low in the sky, casting long, soft shadows from the west. Sunlight filters through the leaves of a massive central tree, creating dappled light on the ground. Windows of the tavern and some homes have a warm, inviting yellow glow. Lanterns are unlit, save for one flickering iron lantern hanging from a hook outside the tavern entrance.\n\n### 2. ARCHITECTURE\n\n*   **Building Styles and Materials:** Predominantly half-timbered construction. Buildings have dark, slightly crooked oak beams forming their skeletons, with rough, cream-colored wattle-and-daub plaster filling the gaps. Lower foundations are made of rough-hewn, irregular grey fieldstone. Roofs are a mix of thick, mossy brown thatch and, for more prosperous buildings like the inn, overlapping terracotta tiles.\n*   **Structural Characteristics:** Buildings are organic and slightly asymmetrical, showing their age. Many feature jettied upper floors that overhang the ground floor, creating covered areas along the street. Rooflines are steep and pitched. No two buildings are identical; some lean slightly, others have additions that look cobbled on over time.\n*   <strong>Scale and Proportions:</strong> Buildings are modestly scaled, typically one or two stories high, feeling approachable rather than imposing. A standard two-story house is about 1.5 times the height of the player character. Doorways are low and rectangular, requiring a tall hero to duck slightly. Windows are small, single-pane affairs with thick wooden frames.\n*   **Distinctive Architectural Features:** The \"Stout Boar\" Tavern is the largest structure, marked by a heavy, carved wooden sign depicting a roaring boar's head. The Blacksmith's workshop is an open-air structure with a stone forge and a tall, soot-stained chimney. The village elder’s home is distinguished by its neatly painted red shutters and a small, well-tended herb garden in the front.\n\n### 3. GROUND SURFACES\n\n*   **Road/Path Materials:** The main thoroughfare through the square is a well-worn, uneven cobblestone path. The stones are rounded and vary in size and shade of grey. Tufts of vibrant green moss and small, resilient weeds grow in the cracks between them.\n*   **Walkable Urban Surfaces:** Dirt paths, packed down by foot traffic, branch off the main cobblestone road towards individual houses. The area directly around the central well is paved with flatter, more uniform flagstones, creating a small, clean plaza.\n*   **Decorative Terrain:** Patches of untamed grass with small white and yellow wildflowers dot the edges of the village square. Small, neat piles of chopped firewood are stacked against the walls of several homes. A few fallen leaves are scattered across the cobblestones.\n*   **Hazardous Areas:** A small, clear stream trickles along the northern edge of the scene, crossed by a simple, sturdy-looking wooden plank bridge. The water is shallow and not a true hazard, with smooth, mossy rocks visible on the creek bed.\n\n### 4. PROPS & OBJECTS\n\n*   **Street Furniture:** A few heavy, hand-carved wooden benches are placed near the central tree. A public notice board, made of a large slab of dark wood, is covered in tattered pieces of parchment and nailed to a post.\n*   **Infrastructure:** The centerpiece of the square is a wide, circular stone well with a wooden roof held up by four posts and covered in the same terracotta tiles as the tavern. It features a thick rope coiled around a wooden crank mechanism. Several large, empty water troughs for horses and livestock are nearby.\n*   **Vegetation and Natural Elements:** A massive, ancient oak tree dominates the center of the square. Its trunk is thick and gnarled, and its low-hanging branches provide a canopy of shade. Small, wooden flower boxes filled with red geraniums hang below the windows of most houses. Ivy creeps up the stone foundations of the older buildings.\n*   **Interactive/Atmospheric Objects:** An assortment of wooden barrels (some with iron bands, some without) and burlap sacks filled with grain are clustered near the tavern's side door. A rusty anvil sits outside the blacksmith's shop. A clothesline with white linen shirts and brown trousers hangs between two houses, gently swaying. Several chickens can be seen pecking at the dirt paths.\n\n### 5. WORLD FLAVOR\n\n*   **Cultural or Era Influences:** Draws from a romanticized, high-fantasy vision of Northern European medieval life. It feels grounded and functional, but clean and idyllic enough to be the hero's starting town.\n*   **Technology Level and Aesthetic:** Early medieval technology. Everything is handcrafted from wood, stone, and iron. There is no magic immediately visible, but the ancient oak tree feels like it could hold some hidden significance. Tools are simple and robust.\n*   **Environmental Storytelling:** The deep ruts in the dirt paths leading out of town suggest frequent wagon traffic to a nearby forest or quarry. A \"Help Wanted: Wyvern Troubles\" notice on the public board hints at nearby dangers and potential quests. The well-kept flower boxes show that the villagers take pride in their homes, despite the rustic setting.\n*   **Unique Distinguishing Features:** The combination of the colossal, ancient oak tree as the village centerpiece and the specific, selective use of terracotta red tiles makes Oakhaven visually distinct from other generic medieval villages. It's \"the village with the giant tree and the red roofs.\""
