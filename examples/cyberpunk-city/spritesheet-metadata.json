  "sceneDescription": "Here is a detailed scene description for the \"cyberpunk city\" theme.\n\n---\n\n### Scene: Neo-Kyoto's Umbral Alley\n\nThis scene depicts a tight, bustling back-alley market in the lower sectors of Neo-Kyoto, a place where black market cybernetics, illicit data, and steaming bowls of synthetic noodles are all for sale under the perpetual twilight of the corporate arcologies above.\n\n### 1. VISUAL IDENTITY\n*   **Primary Color Palette:**\n    *   Deep Indigo (#1A234A): The base color for shadows, deep puddles, and the sliver of night sky visible between towering buildings.\n    *   Electric Magenta (#FF00E0): The dominant color of neon signage, holographic ads, and glowing cybernetic interfaces.\n    *   Sickly Cyan (#00FFFF): A secondary neon color used for medical bay signs, data-stream projections, and hazardous liquid spills.\n*   **Secondary/Accent Colors:** A dirty, metallic gold (#B8A400) for warning signs and some logos. A deep, wet-asphalt gray (#333333).\n*   **Overall Mood and Atmosphere:** Oppressive and claustrophobic, yet vibrantly alive. The mood is \"electric gloom\"—a constant sense of dampness and decay punctuated by blinding flashes of high technology. It feels dangerous but full of energy and opportunity.\n*   **Lighting Conditions:** Perpetual night, illuminated almost entirely by artificial, diegetic light sources. A constant, light drizzle falls, making every surface slick and reflective. The primary light comes from pulsating, flickering neon signs written in Japanese Katakana and English. Holographic advertisements for cyber-arms and data havens cast shifting, colored light onto the ground and walls.\n\n### 2. ARCHITECTURE\n*   **Building Styles and Materials:** A chaotic fusion of old and new. The base structures are pockmarked, brutalist concrete from a bygone era, now almost completely obscured by layers of haphazard additions. These include rusted corrugated metal sheets, sleek dark-polymer panels bolted directly onto the concrete, and external life-support systems.\n*   **Structural Characteristics:** Aggressively vertical and angular. Buildings lean into one another, creating a narrow canyon of an alley. There are no gentle curves. Rickety metal catwalks and external staircases crisscross the space several stories up, connecting different buildings.\n*   **Scale and Proportions:** The buildings are immense and loom over the player, who will feel small and insignificant. Doorways are standard size, but are often recessed into the grimy walls, framed by thick bundles of cables. Massive, humming ventilation units are embedded in the walls far above character height.\n*   **Distinctive Architectural Features:** Exposed, thick conduits and data-cables snake up the building faces like metallic ivy. Some windows are traditional glass, streaked with grime, while others are digital screens displaying looping, glitching advertisements. Occasional Kanji characters are spray-painted as graffiti over corporate logos.\n\n### 3. GROUND SURFACES\n*   **Road/Path Materials:** The main path is cracked, dark gray asphalt. It's uneven and riddled with potholes filled with an oily, iridescent rainwater that vividly reflects the neon glow from above.\n*   **Walkable Urban Surfaces:** The main path is bordered by raised metal gratings that cover a deep, dark drainage channel below. Steam periodically vents up through these grates. Patches of worn-down concrete sidewalk are visible where the gratings have been removed or damaged.\n*   **Decorative Terrain:** Piles of discarded e-waste are heaped in corners: cracked monitors, tangled nests of fiber-optic cables, and scavenged chrome casings. Overflowing, translucent trash bags reveal discarded synth-food containers and old circuit boards.\n*   **Hazardous Areas:** The oily puddles are purely aesthetic, but certain exposed power junctions on the ground will intermittently spark with blue electricity, creating a small, temporary hazard zone. Some pools of liquid glow with the sickly cyan of toxic coolant runoff.\n\n### 4. PROPS & OBJECTS\n*   **Street Furniture:** No traditional benches. Seating consists of stacked, rusty cargo crates or overturned buckets. Street food stalls are constructed from repurposed shipping containers, with holographic menus displaying ramen bowls and skewers. Vending machines with brightly lit fronts dispense strange, glowing energy drinks in oddly shaped cans.\n*   **Infrastructure:** Thick bundles of multicolored cables are strung overhead, drooping low in the center of the alley. Large, cylindrical ventilation fans are set into the walls, slowly rotating and puffing out clouds of white steam. Junction boxes with covers pried off reveal a chaotic tangle of wires.\n*   **Vegetation and Natural Elements:** Life struggles to exist here. The only \"natural\" elements are patches of sickly, bioluminescent fungus growing in damp corners and a single, resilient bonsai tree in a ceramic pot on a vendor's stall, its leaves unnaturally glossy.\n*   **Interactive/Atmospheric Objects:** A discarded, spider-like security drone lies on its side, its single red optical lens cracked. Holographic koi fish, part of an advertisement for a data haven, \"swim\" through the air in a repeating pattern. Manhole covers intermittently release plumes of thick, white steam that dissipate into the rain.\n\n### 5. WORLD FLAVOR\n*   **Cultural or Era Influences:** Heavily influenced by 1980s Japanese cyberpunk aesthetics and the real-world density of places like the former Kowloon Walled City. The mix of English and Japanese on signs suggests a fusion of cultures in this mega-city.\n*   **Technology Level:** High-tech, low-life. Advanced technology like personal cybernetics and sentient A.I. is commonplace but is often malfunctioning, jury-rigged, or sold on the black market. The aesthetic is functional and gritty, not sleek or sterile.\n*   **Environmental Storytelling:** Graffiti from local gangs (\"The Vipers,\" \"Chrome Skulls\") is sprayed over the logos of monolithic corporations (\"OmniCorp,\" \"Bio-Gene\"). The density of cybernetic repair shops and back-alley clinics hints that physical augmentation is a dangerous and necessary part of life in the lower sectors. The sheer volume of discarded tech tells a story of rampant consumerism and planned obsolescence.\n*   **Unique Distinguishing Features:** The air itself feels heavy with data. Occasionally, the player's view could be overlaid with a split-second of visual \"static\" or a glitching data fragment, as if stray signals are constantly bombarding them. This makes the environment feel actively hostile and digitally saturated."
